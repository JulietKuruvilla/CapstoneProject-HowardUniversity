Exploring The Impact of Family History and Lifestyle Factors on Colorectal Cancer Risk
---
## Overview

This project aim to analyze and identify potential risk factors associated with colorectal cancer. By analyzing the potential risk factors, we aim to evaluate the independent and combined effects of identified risk factors on the incidence and progression of colorectal cancer. This project focuses on developing predictive models and identify which model works best to determine an individualâ€™s risk factors for colorectal cancer. 

## Project Specific Key Features

- Integrates colorectal cancer, and lifestyle datasets.
- Develops predictive models using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Identifies potential features at high risk contributing to the onset and progression of colorectal cancer.
- Aims to support data-driven decisions to determine an individual's risk factors for colorectal cancer.

## Getting Started

### Data Sources

We utilized the following datasets after submittig a request with the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

- **Pancreatic, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Dataset from the National Cancer Institute (NCI):** The colorectal dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains all the PLCO study data available for colorectal cancer screening, incidence, and mortality analysis. This dataset contains one record for each of the approximately 155,000 participants in the PLCO trial. ([https://cdas.cancer.gov/datasets/plco/](https://cdas.cancer.gov/datasets/plco/))
- **Healthy Lifestyle Dataset from the National Cancer Institute (NCI):** This dataset includes scores calculated for ~60,000 participants at baseline. ([https://cdas.cancer.gov/datasets/plco/](https://cdas.cancer.gov/datasets/plco/))
